# Description of Dataset

#Question 1
Is there a correlation between newer PHEV and BEV car models and longer electric car ranges? And if so, how significant is that correlation?

Significance:

This question is important because it helps someone better understand their options based on which cars and their ranges best suit their needs. The answer and its visualization are especially useful when considering questions like “How far am I driving in a given day?” and ”How often am I stopping long enough to charge the battery if needed?” This will help consumers determine what model years have lower average driving ranges and learn to avoid them in search of newer models that are shown to have increasingly improved distance capabilities. This question also enables one to see how BEV efficiency development is growing at a much faster rate than that of the PHEVs.

# Manipulations to the dataset for Analysis
We did not manipulate any raw data, but we did filter out irrelevant data and apply measurable functions to certain columns. In Q1, we filtered data to only include the top 20 makes of EVs with model year 2008 or later. We also applied the count function to "Electric Vehicle Range" in order to show the number of EV types and discrepancies between EV makes. For Q2, we applied the average function to "Electric Range '' to set a standard for comparing the electric range year-after-year in the graph. All filters/marks applied to the data are solely intended to show the viewer quantifiable information related to the questions. In regards to integrity, our data has no inaccuracies, irrelevancies, or 3rd party imports.
