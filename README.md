# Manipulations to the dataset for Analysis
We did not manipulate any raw data, but we did apply measurable functions to certain columns. For example, we applied the count function to "Electric Vehicle Range" in Q1 in order to show the number of EV types and discrepencies between EV makes. Also, we applied the average function to "Electric Range" in Q2 to set a standard for comparing the electric range year-after-year in the graph. All filters/marks applied to the data are solely intended to show the viewer quantifiable information related to the questions. In regards to integrety, our data has no inaccuracies, irrelevancies, or 3rd party imports.
